Using Hugging Face, I have developed three unique sentiment analysis models to enhance text data understanding across different languages and formats:
English Sentiment Analysis Model: Utilizes the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment model to classify English text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.
Arabic Sentiment Analysis Model: Leverages the CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-da-sentiment model for sentiment analysis of Arabic text, providing insights for Arabic content. 
Emoji-Based Sentiment Analysis Model: Uses the cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-large-emoji-latest model to classify sentiments expressed through emojis, ideal for social media and informal text analysis.
